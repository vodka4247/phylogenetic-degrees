Here you can find the code for computing the phylogenetic degree for Jukes-Cantor model (group-based model for Z2) and any path-tree. By the path-tree we mean the tree which has k inner vertices which form a path
The command latticevolume([a_1,...,a_n]) compute the lattice volume of the associated polytope for the path tree where inner vertices has a_1,..,a_k leaves. To obtain the degree one has to divide by 2^k. It is likely that the code can be improved but it works and that is important. If you want to know more about phylogenetic degrees you can read our article available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20184.
